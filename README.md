# Happy - CodeClan final project

## Goal

Create a responsive mobile app allowing the user to track their mood over time and suggest appropriate internet resources to help improve mood and wellbeing. The app is inspired by the difficulties many people are experiencing during ‘lockdown’ and designed to tie in with Mental Health Awareness Week.

## Tech

JavaScript/React, Java/Spring, H2.

## MVP

* The user is prompted to create a profile with basic details such as age, dietary preference, fitness level, favourite music type, etc.
* Once a profile is created, the app greets the user by name on opening, and does not show the profile creation steps again
* Profile should be able to be updated by the user
* The user can log their mood each day using a simple icon/emoji based input field, as well as an optional free text box
* The mood data over time can be viewed as a graph/bar chart
* Appropriate mental health advice (NHS, Samaritans, Mind etc) will be available in one click (eg a “HELP” button) 

## Extensions

* Suggestions could be tailored to the mood rating the user has entered that day. Help links will be suggested automatically if the user inputs a VERY BAD mood rating
* User can enter multiple mood changes each day
* The user can set the app to send a daily inspirational quote
* The app suggests  links each day to uplifting quotes/affirmations and/or music tracks, recipes, articles etc . 
* App ‘learns’ the users preferences over time and suggests more tailored content
* The user can set the app to send them a push notification reminder
* Add a ‘sign up’ page for first use of the app
